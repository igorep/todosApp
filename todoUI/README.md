Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

- Implement a Todo List with Hooks
  -- Create a functional React component that allows a user to add, edit, and delete tasks using useState.
  -- Add a checkbox to mark tasks as completed, and filter to display only completed tasks.
  -- Bonus: Use useEffect to save the list to localStorage.

- Implement a Debounced Search Component
  -- Create a search bar that fetches data from an API based on user input.
  -- Use the useEffect hook and a debounce function to avoid unnecessary API calls on every keystroke.

- Build a Counter with useReducer
  -- Create a simple counter using the useReducer hook.
  -- The counter should support increment, decrement, and reset actions.
  -- Bonus: Add validation to prevent the counter from going below zero.
